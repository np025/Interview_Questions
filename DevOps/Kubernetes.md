# Kubernetes Interview Questions

## Common Questions

### 1. What is Kubernetes, and why is it important in the world of container orchestration?
Kubernetes, or K8s, is an open-source platform that automates deploying, scaling, and managing containerized applications. It simplifies the orchestration of containers, providing scalability, self-healing, and efficient resource utilization. It is important because it reduces operational overhead and enhances reliability for modern applications.

### 2. Explain the key components of Kubernetes and their roles in container management.
- **Master Node**: Manages the cluster and serves as the control plane.
- **Worker Nodes**: Run containerized workloads within Pods.
- **Pods**: The smallest deployable unit, encapsulating one or more containers.
- **Services**: Provide network connectivity and load balancing for Pods.
- **Etcd**: A key-value store for cluster state.
- **Scheduler**: Assigns workloads to nodes based on resource availability.
- **Controller Manager**: Ensures the desired state of the cluster.

### 3. How do you deploy a containerized application on a Kubernetes cluster? Walk me through the process.
1. Create YAML files for Deployment and Service definitions.
2. Apply them using `kubectl apply -f <file>`.
3. Monitor the deployment with `kubectl get pods` and `kubectl get services`.
4. Access the application using the Service's endpoint.

### 4. Describe Kubernetes Deployments and StatefulSets. What are the differences, and when would you use one over the other?
- **Deployments**: Best for stateless applications, offering scalability and rolling updates.
- **StatefulSets**: Used for stateful applications, maintaining stable network identities and persistent storage.

### 5. How does Kubernetes handle load balancing for containerized applications?
Kubernetes Services provide load balancing. ClusterIP balances traffic internally, while NodePort and LoadBalancer Services expose applications externally, ensuring even distribution of traffic to healthy Pods.

### 6. What is a Kubernetes Namespace, and why would you use multiple namespaces in a cluster?
Namespaces partition a cluster into virtual sub-clusters, isolating resources for different environments or teams. They prevent resource conflicts and simplify access control.

### 7. Explain the concept of Kubernetes Services and how they enable network connectivity for Pods.
Services offer stable network endpoints for Pods. They abstract dynamic Pod IPs and provide communication within the cluster and to external users.

### 8. What is the role of a Kubernetes Ingress controller, and how does it work?
An Ingress controller manages HTTP and HTTPS traffic to the cluster, enabling external access to services via URLs, load balancing, and SSL termination.

### 9. What is Kubernetes' role in auto-scaling, and how can you set up Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA)?
HPA scales Pods based on CPU, memory, or custom metrics. It is configured using resource metrics and thresholds defined in Deployment specifications.

### 10. Describe Kubernetes rolling updates and canary deployments. When and why would you use each approach?
- **Rolling Updates**: Gradually replace Pods to minimize downtime.
- **Canary Deployments**: Deploy a small percentage of traffic to the new version to validate changes before full rollout.

### 11. Explain Kubernetes' role in self-healing and how it handles container failures.
Kubernetes automatically restarts failed containers, reschedules Pods on healthy nodes, and replaces unresponsive Pods, ensuring application continuity.

### 12. What are Kubernetes ConfigMaps and Secrets, and how do they differ in terms of storing configuration data?
- **ConfigMaps**: Store non-sensitive data, such as environment variables and configuration files.
- **Secrets**: Store sensitive data like credentials, encrypted for security.

### 13. How would you upgrade a Kubernetes cluster to a new version while minimizing downtime?
1. Backup the cluster state.
2. Upgrade the master node first, followed by worker nodes.
3. Use rolling updates for workloads.

### 14. What is a Helm chart, and how does it simplify application deployment on Kubernetes?
Helm charts package Kubernetes manifests into reusable templates, enabling simplified, consistent deployments with parameterization.

### 15. How do you monitor a Kubernetes cluster and its workloads? Mention some popular monitoring and logging solutions for Kubernetes.
Popular tools include Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack, Fluentd, and Kubernetes-native metrics-server for real-time insights.

### 16. Explain Kubernetes RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) and how you would configure it to secure your cluster.
RBAC restricts cluster access by defining Roles and RoleBindings. Roles specify permissions, and RoleBindings assign them to users or service accounts.

### 17. Describe the concept of "Immutable Infrastructure" and how it relates to Kubernetes.
Immutable infrastructure ensures environments are rebuilt from scratch instead of modified. Kubernetes supports this with container images and declarative manifests.

### 18. How do you handle secrets rotation for applications running in Kubernetes, and why is it important?
Secrets rotation involves updating and redeploying new secrets securely. It minimizes security risks from compromised credentials.

### 19. Discuss the challenges and best practices for running stateful applications in Kubernetes, such as databases.
Challenges include data persistence, backups, and scaling. Best practices involve using StatefulSets, persistent volumes, and scheduled snapshots.

### 20. Share an example of a complex Kubernetes project you've worked on, highlighting the challenges you faced and how you overcame them.
Details will depend on the candidate's experience, focusing on design, scaling, or troubleshooting challenges.
